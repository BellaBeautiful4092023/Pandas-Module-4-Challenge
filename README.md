# Pandas-Module-4-Challenge
PyCitySchools 
Average math and reading scores stay consistent across grade levels when grouped by school.  There is no major improvement in scores from any school.
Math passing rates are always consistently lower across every metric, but the difference between math and reading passing rates is greater among lower-performing schools, large schools, and higher spending per student which all seem to correlate.
The top 5 schools are all charter schools while the bottom 5 all district schools.
In general (one exception), per-student spending is higher in bottom-performing schools than top top-performing.
Schools under 2000 students have much higher passing rates than those with student populations above 2000.  A comparison of 95 to 75%.  The same phenomenon is seen with high and low per-student spending brackets and district versus charter schools.

These are what we are to look for:
District Summary
Create a high-level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
School Summary
Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.
Math Scores by Grade**
Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Reading Scores by Grade
Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
Scores by School Size
Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).
Scores by School Type
Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
